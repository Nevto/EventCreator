# EventCreator
School Project to create a smart contract that can handle the creation of a event. You will be able to register by paying a fee, registration will be closed after a deadline. You should be able to create a new event, open and close registration and handle payments.


Added Reentrancy protection from open zeppelin, just an added layer of security. The contract itself is secure because only the owner can withdraw money, but then again having more security is never bad for the end-user.
